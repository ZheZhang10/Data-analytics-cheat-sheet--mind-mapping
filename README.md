# Data-analytics-cheat-sheet--mind-mapping

For the first version of mapping, this mapping is divided into three parts: data preparation, prediction and clustering. The two main categories are prediction and clustering which mainly describes what it is?(in the remarks) How it is? when to use? For each proper noun, I attach a picture (which is a better presentation) for your reference.  

Future work:  
1. collect more advice to fix and improve    
2. add more details about data understanding and data preparation   
3. add clustering measure method     
4. add development docs link
